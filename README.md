# Vagrant for Forge Server

Forked from [vagrant_minecraft](https://github.com/stephen-mw/vagrant_minecraft). Modified to run a Forge server.

# Usage

- Install VirtualBox
- Install Vagrant
- Clone this repo
- Put any mods you like in the `mods` dir. They will be loaded into the server.
- Run `vagrant up`

- Run minecraft
- Create a new profile
- Set the `Game Directory` to the place you installed Vagrant -> gameDirectory. Now your mods will be loaded in to your client as well.
- Play
